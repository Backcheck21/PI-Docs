For people who want to contribute by writing/updating/translating documentation.

I will get around to writing proper documentation for this at some point but for now here is a brief step by step guide.
To do this you will need at least a basic understanding of git, github and pull requests.

1. Clone the PI-Docs repo from §link[https://github.com/brandon3055/PI-Docs]
 
2. Switch PI to edit mode via the settings button in the UI. You should be prompted enter the path to the "ModDocs" folder that exists in the repo you just cloned. Copy-Paste or type the path (e.g. C\Users\<your name>\Documents\PI-Docs\ModDocs) then press ok

3. Press the "Open PI Editor" button that should now be displayed at the top of the main PI Gui. The editor should be pretty self explanitory just make sure you read all of the help topics displayed by the "?" buttons in the editor.

4. All changes are automatically saved to your local clone of the PI repo. Once you have finished writing documentation simply create a pull request.

Please note not all features in the editor are fully implemented. If you run into trouble feel free to ask for help via the Draconic Evolution discord §link[https://discord.gg/e2HBEtF]

###### Pack Documentation (Local Doc)
This is a feature intended for mod pack developers. It allows you to create documentation that can be shipped with the mod pack as opposed to having to be uploaded to the repository. This documentation is identical to Mod Doc but is stored in config/brandon3055/ProjectIntelligence/PackDocs
